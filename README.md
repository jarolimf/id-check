# ID Online Checker

This is a simple Python script to compare two ID lists with each other. The web app was made with the open-source Python framework, [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

## Usage

Compare two lists with each other by either a file upload of two .txt files, or manual input of two ID lists.
Currently, you can display IDs that are available in both lists, and IDs that are not available in both lists, and save said result in a .txt file to your computer.
